# AngularJS routing experiments
### Using different AngularJS (1.6) routers (ui-router/$stateProvider, angular-route/$routeProvider) in different combinations
#### Based on [ng18-starter](https://github.com/loenko/ng18-starter)

#### Experiments by branches:
* `master` - `ui-router`-managed module (standalone app as a module) inside of `ngRoute`-managed app 
* `ui-router` - `ui-router`-managed module (standalone app as a module) inside of `ui-router`-managed app 
* `ng-route` - `ngRoute`-managed module (standalone app as a module) inside of `ngRoute`-managed app
